# Rhytmo Design System

The Rhytmo Design System is the creative backbone of the Gibson guitar brand's digital experience. It is designed to maintain consistency, scalability, and accessibility across all user interactions, ensuring a harmonious blend of form and function that reflects Gibson's legacy and innovation.

## ðŸŽ¨ Styling

The design system uses styled-components for styling. This allows for modular and reusable component styles.

## ðŸŒŸ Design Tokens

Our design tokens are managed using Style Dictionary. To build the tokens, run:

```
npm run build:tokens
```

This will generate the necessary design tokens and TypeScript declarations based on the configuration.

All base colors are already defined. Use Figma or adjust JSON to add component specific tokens.
